#GitHub Issue page for OFF Business:
Created a clone of the GitHub Issues Page using React, HTML, CSS, JS, and the GitHub API with an infinite scroll feature, and deployed it on Vercel. Ideally I wanted to implement ATOMIC design structure with unit testing but since I had to complete it given time frame I have not used ATOMIC design and Unit Testing.
